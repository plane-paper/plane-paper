# Hi there! I'm Richard, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.👋

## 🚀 About Me

I'm Richard, a passionate bi(tri?)lingual developer exploring various fields in computer science. I love building innovative solutions and exploring new technologies to solve real-world problems.

Most of the projects (and the repos I own on GitHub) are things I do for fun, or some cool ideas I came up with. Sometimes I also build APIs and developer tools, and very occasionally I will try to research new things - however, both of these usually come back to aid me in developing more fun stuff!

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, H5, CSS, Typescript
- **Backend:** JS, Django, Flask, Node.js, FastAPI, MCP
- **Scripting:** Powershell, Batch
- **OOP:** C#, C++, Python
- **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplot, MatLab, PyKrige, Cartopy
- **Embedded Development:** STM 32, Rasp Pi, Arduino
- **CI/CD**: YAML, GitHub Actions
- **Machine Learning:** Tensorflow, Pytorch, SpaCy, SKLearn
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Others:** Docker, Git (obviously), VS, Anaconda, IntelliJ, Node/Yarn, etc

## 📌 Current Projects

- 🔥 [**SnapLearn**](https://github.com/plane-paper/SnapLearn) - Using NLP techniques and language models to create custom curriculums from any textbook, based on the user's availability and the pre-requisite nature of the topics to be covered.
- 🚀 [**Goblinator**](https://github.com/plane-paper/Goblinator) - Using LlaMa and the Reddit API to fetch brainrot content in JSON, fine-tune a language model to translate it to English and the other way around, and finally build an API and a Front-end to publish the app to users.
- 🎈[**Quicksilver**](https://github.com/plane-paper/Quicksilver) - Using sockets and pybluez to develop a lightweight, user-friendly, easily-scalable, file transfer system that involves auto-broadcast and seeking, and direct file transfer without using an intermediary or a database, both via Bluetooth and on the LAN.
