# Hi there! I'm Richard, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.👋

## 🚀 About Me

I'm Richard, a passionate bilingual developer exploring various fields in computer science. I love building innovative solutions and exploring new technologies to solve real-world problems.

Most of the projects (and the repos I own on GitHub) are things I do for fun, or some cool ideas I came up with. Sometimes I also build APIs and developer tools, and very occasionally I will try to research new things - however, both of these usually come back to aid me in developing more fun stuff!

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, H5, CSS
- **Backend:** JS, Django, Flask, Node.js
- **Scripting:** Powershell, Batch, Python
- **Compiled:** C#, C, C++
- **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplot, MatLab, PyKrige, Cartopy
- **Embedded Development:** STM 32, Rasp Pi, Arduino
- **Machine Learning:** Tensorflow, Pytorch, SpaCy, SKLearn
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Others:** Docker, Visual Studio, Jupyter, Anaconda

## 📌 Current Projects

- 🔥 [**KnowledgeHunt**](https://github.com/plane-paper/KnowledgeHunt) - Using NLP techniques (SpaCy and SciKit-Learn) to create a questionbank query software that allows students to generate customized question sets based on difficulty and topic.
- 🚀 [**YourSweeper**](https://github.com/plane-paper/YourSweeper) - Using OpenCV to analyze MineSweeper windows on screen, then creating an optimized strategy to automatically solve the game, fully automated with PythonGUI.
